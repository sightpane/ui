description: Update GitHub Pull Request titles and descriptions for sightpane/ui with precise context — what changed in the Flutter web dashboard (shadcn_flutter, Riverpod 3, go_router), any change to the envelope wire protocol or the SQLite schema, and the verification actually run. Use whenever the user asks to "update the PR", "write a PR description", "PR aç", "PR'ı güncelle", or "add details to the pull request".

> **This repository is one of three.** [sightpane/sightpane](https://github.com/sightpane/sightpane)
> is the Go backend, [sightpane/ui](https://github.com/sightpane/ui) the Flutter web
> dashboard, [sightpane/flutter](https://github.com/sightpane/flutter) the Dart SDK.
> The only thing they share is the envelope contract (`POST /api/v1/envelope`), so a
> change to it needs a matching change in the other two — say so explicitly rather
> than assuming whoever reads this can see them.

# PR Writer

Authors professional pull request titles and descriptions for sightpane and applies them with the GitHub CLI (`gh`). Repo: `sightpane/ui` (three sub-projects in one repo: `package/` SDK, `backend/` Go server, `frontend/` Flutter web dashboard).

## Intent & Triggers
- "Update the PR description" / "PR'ı güncelle"
- "Write the PR title and body" / "PR açıklaması yaz"
- "Open a PR for this" / "PR aç" (create, then describe)

## Workflow

### 1. Gather context
Understand what was actually done — do not guess.
- Conversation history and `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD`, `git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD`.
- Which parts changed: SDK (`package/lib/src`), backend (`store.go`, `api.go`, `auth.go`, `fingerprint.go`, `main.go`), dashboard (`frontend/lib`), Docker (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`), docs (READMEs).
- **Contract changes** deserve their own bullet: a new envelope item type or field (`package/lib/src/models.dart` ↔ `backend/internal/store/store.go` `itemHead`/`Ingest`), a new API endpoint (`backend/api.go` routes), a SQLite column (`store.go` `migrate()` + the `ALTER TABLE` list), a new `SIGHTPANE_*`/`SIGHTPANE_API_URL` env var.
- **CRITICAL:** only list things that were explicitly implemented in this branch.

### 2. Check existing PRs
```bash
env -u GITHUB_TOKEN gh pr status
env -u GITHUB_TOKEN gh pr view <number> --json title,body,url
```
`GITHUB_TOKEN` in this environment is a dummy that causes 401; always run `gh` with `env -u GITHUB_TOKEN`. If no PR exists and the user asked you to open one: `env -u GITHUB_TOKEN gh pr create --title … --body-file …`. Otherwise ask.

### 3. Draft the content
Write the body to a temp file (`/tmp/pr_description.md`); pass the title as a flag, not inside the body. Write in the language the user is using (the READMEs are Turkish; Turkish bodies are fine).

```markdown
## Özet / Description
[1–2 paragraphs: the objective and why it matters]

### 🚀 Ne yapıldı
#### 1. SDK (`package/`)
- **`lib/src/queue.dart`**: exact change and its effect on the user of the SDK.
#### 2. Backend (`backend/`)
- **`store.go`**: new column `sessions.ip` (+ ALTER for existing DBs), `clientIP` header order …
#### 3. Dashboard (`frontend/`)
- …
#### 4. Docker / config / docs
- …

### 🔌 Contract changes
- Envelope: new item type `pointer` (`events[{t,x,y,k}]`) — old backends reject it as … / accept and ignore.
- API: `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/live` …
- Schema: `sessions.browser`, `sessions.visitor_key` (ALTER in `migrate()`).
- Env: `SIGHTPANE_PROXY_PROTOCOL`, `SIGHTPANE_TRUSTED_PROXIES`.
(Write "None" when there are none.)

### ✅ Doğrulama / Verification
- `cd package && flutter analyze && flutter test` → N tests
- `cd backend && go vet ./... && go test ./...` → ok
- `flutter analyze && flutter test && flutter build web --dart-define-from-file=config.json`
- `docker build -t sightpane .` / `docker compose up -d --build` and the curl checks actually run (health, `/api/v1/envelope` 202, frame png 200 …)
- Live checks against a running backend (`package/tool/smoke_send.dart`, browser session in the dashboard) — say what was observed, and what was **not** verified (e.g. "real browser replay not checked").
- Breaking changes: state explicitly, or "None".

### 4. Commit, push, apply
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "feat(scope): concise message

Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git push origin HEAD
env -u GITHUB_TOKEN gh pr edit "$PR_NUMBER" --title "$TITLE" --body-file /tmp/pr_description.md
```
PR bodies end with `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`.

### 5. Confirm
Report the PR link and a one-line summary of what changed in the description.

## Writing guidelines
- Conventional-commit titles with a scope: `feat(sdk): …`, `fix(backend): …`, `feat(dashboard): …`, `chore(docker): …`, `docs: …`.
- Exact file names, endpoints, env vars, item types.
- Numbers only where they change what the reader does (test counts, measured speedups).
- Never describe verification you did not run.
